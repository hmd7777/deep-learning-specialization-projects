# Attention Model for Machine Translation ✨

Implements the **Bahdanau (additive) attention** mechanism to enhance sequence-to-sequence translation performance.

## 🧩 Concepts Demonstrated
- Attention weights and alignment
- Context vector computation
- Visualization of attention heat-maps
- Comparison of vanilla vs attention-based seq2seq models

## ⚙️ Tools
Python 3.11, TensorFlow 2/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📊 Result
Significant improvement in translation fluency (↑ BLEU score).

## 📚 Reference
Assignment from *DeepLearning.AI – Sequence Models (Coursera)*.
