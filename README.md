# Deep Learning Specialization — Project Collection

This repository contains my implementations of the major assignments and projects from the **Deep Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** and **DeepLearning.AI** on Coursera.

Each folder corresponds to a course or specific project within the specialization and includes:
- The original **Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)**
- A **PDF export** for quick viewing
- A brief **README** describing the project, concepts, and results
