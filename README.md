# Deep Learning Specialization — Project Collection

This repository contains my implementations of the major assignments and projects from the **Deep Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** and **DeepLearning.AI** on Coursera.

Each folder corresponds to a course or specific project within the specialization and includes:
- The original **Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)**
- A **PDF export** for quick viewing
- A brief **README** describing the project, concepts, and results

## 📚 Courses Covered

| Course | Title | Focus |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Neural Networks and Deep Learning | Forward/Backward Propagation, Logistic Regression, Basic NNs |
| 2 | Improving Deep Neural Networks | Regularization, Optimization, Initialization |
| 4 | Convolutional Neural Networks | CNNs, Transfer Learning, Computer Vision |
| 5 | Sequence Models | RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Seq2Seq, Attention Mechanisms |

*(Course 3 — Structuring ML Projects — was theory-based and had no code assignments.)*
