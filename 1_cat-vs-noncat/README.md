# Cat vs Non-Cat Classifier 🐱

This project implements a **binary image classifier** from scratch using **NumPy**.  
It was the final assignment in *Course 1 – Neural Networks and Deep Learning* from the DeepLearning.AI specialization by Andrew Ng.

## 🧩 Concepts Demonstrated
- Forward and backward propagation
- Logistic regression as a neural network
- L-layer deep network implementation
- Vectorized operations for efficiency
- Cost function and gradient descent

## ⚙️ Tools
Python 3.11, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib

## 📊 Result
~80–85 % test accuracy on 64 × 64 px images.

## 📚 Reference
Assignment from *DeepLearning.AI – Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Coursera)*.
